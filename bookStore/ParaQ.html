Mapping eh automatico

DTO - Used to transfer data between the Application Layer and the Presentation Layer

Application services- used to implement the use cases of an application. They are used to expose domain logic to the
presentation layer.

Interfaces - include behavior from multiple sources in a class. That capability is important in C# because the language
doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes
